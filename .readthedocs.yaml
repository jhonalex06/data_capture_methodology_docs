Add a project configuration file
Make sure your project has a .readthedocs.yaml configuration file at the root directory of your repository. This file is required by Read the Docs to build your documentation. You can read more about our configuration file in our documentation.

Here is an example configuration file for a project using Sphinx:

# .readthedocs.yaml
# Read the Docs configuration file
# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html for details

# Required
version: 2

# Set the OS, Python version and other tools you might need
build:
  os: ubuntu-22.04
  tools:
    python: "3.10"
    # You can also specify other tool versions:
    # nodejs: "19"
    # rust: "1.64"
    # golang: "1.19"

# Build documentation in the "docs/" directory with Sphinx
sphinx:
   configuration: source/conf.py

# Optionally build your docs in additional formats such as PDF and ePub
# formats:
#    - pdf
#    - epub

# Optional but recommended, declare the Python requirements required
# to build your documentation
# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/reproducible-builds.html
python:
   install:
   - requirements: source/requirements.txt
